    "\n",
    "ROS stands for Robot Operating System, and it is a set of libraries for robotics programming. ROS is incredibly useful for robotics due to the sheer number of useful packages which ROS offers. ROS allows for easier communication between robot hardware and computer software, provides tools for visualization and graphing capabilities, and much more. \n",
    "\n",
    "The version of ROS we will be using is ROS 2 Iron. This is the version of ROS supported for the AR4 by Annin Robotics (the robot which we are using for this research project). It is recommended to use ROS 2 Iron with Ubuntu Linux 22.04, and so we must first install a virtual machine to be able to use this operating system. If you are not familiar with the concept of a virtual machine, it is essentially another computer running within your computer (aka a computer emulator). This way, you do not need a physical Ubuntu machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief summary of the steps needed to download Ubuntu on a VMWare VM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Download VMWare: https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=VMware+Fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "   You will first need to register for a myBroadcom account. Then, you can sign in and you will be brought to the VMWare Fusion installation page. Download \"VMWare Fusion 13 Pro for Personal Use\".\n",
    "   \n",
    "2) Download an Ubuntu image: https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/ (use the 22.04 LTS version Jammy Jellyfish and select \"Desktop Image\")\n",
    "   NOTE: It is important to use the 22.04 version, as the current LTS version is NOT compatible with ROS 2 Iron.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "3) Create a virtual machine by running VMWare and clicking the \"+\" button at the top of the screen.\n",
    "    -Name this virtual machine \"Ubuntu\" or something similar\n",
    "    -For the ISO image, select your downloaded Ubuntu image\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Click start to launch your newly created virtual machine and follow the setup instructions on the screen\n",
    "\n",
    "More detailed installation instructions can be found through the following link: https://medium.com/@florenceify74/how-to-download-install-and-run-ubuntu-in-vmware-workstation-ce5f2d4d0438\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing Ubuntu, we can begin installation of our ROS 2 Iron Irwini software. This can be done by following the installation instructions found in the ROS 2 documentation: https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Open the terminal of your Ubuntu virtual machine. First, we will set the system locale:\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "locale  # check for UTF-8\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales\n",
    "sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8\n",
    "sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n",
    "export LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n",
    "\n",
    "locale  # verify settings\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Next, we will enable the required repositories to properly use ROS 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo apt install software-properties-common\n",
    "sudo add-apt-repository universe\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y\n",
    "sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg\n",

    "\n",
    "echo \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Next, we will install the development tools required to build ROS packages in the future:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "sudo apt update && sudo apt install ros-dev-tools\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The last step before installing the ROS software is to update our apt repository caches and ensure our system is up to date:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "sudo apt update\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "sudo apt upgrade\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Now, we can run the command to install ROS Iron for Desktop:\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "sudo apt install ros-iron-desktop\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Each time we wish to launch an ros2 file, we must first set up our environment. We can do so via the following environment setup command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "source /opt/ros/iron/setup.bash\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7) We have now installed ROS 2. To ensure proper the software has been properly installed, you can run an example such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "source /opt/ros/iron/setup.bash\n",
    "ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have ROS 2 installed, we will use ROS 2 with our AR4 robotic arm. The ROS 2 driver for this arm can be found through the following GitHub page: https://github.com/ycheng517/ar4_ros_driver. The installation instructions are found in the README file of this GitHub page, although I will also go over them here. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) First, open a new terminal window in your Ubuntu virtual machine and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/ycheng517/ar4_ros_driver\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "This will clone the GitHub repository described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Next, we must import the external repositories required for our workspace:\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "vcs import . --input ar_hand_eye/hand_eye_calibration.repos\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Next, we must install needed dependencies using rosdep:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Next, let's cd into our ar4_ros_driver and build our workspace:\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "cd ar4_ros_driver\n",
    "colcon build\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Now, we must set up our workspace by sourcing the workspace:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "source install/setup.bash\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Finally, let's add serial port access such that we can eventually use our ROS control for the physical AR4 robot:\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "sudo addgroup $USER dialout\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have cloned the GitHub repository and installed the needed dependencies, let's use Gazebo, RViz, and Moveit to visualize our AR4 robot and move it around. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Start up the Gazebo simulation in one terminal window (remember to use source to set up your environment):\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "ros2 launch ar_gazebo ar_gazebo.launch.py\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Start up Moveit and RViz in a second terminal window to be able to control the motion of our simulated robot. Once again, use source to set up your environment first. \n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "ros2 launch ar_moveit_config ar_moveit.launch.py use_sim_time:=true include_gripper:=True\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have everything set up for visualizing the AR4, you can explore with the Gazebo software as well as with RViz. Try moving around the robot and experimenting. \n"

    "## Part 2: Basics of Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have completed the setup of our Gazebo simulation, let's get into the basics of reinforcement learning within the context of robotics. We eventually want to use the AR4 robot as our robotic agent, where our environment will be represented in the Gazebo simulator. However, for the context of this activity, we will be implementing reinforcement learning with a far simpler agent, environment, and goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"Reinforcement Learning\" describes the process in which an agent (such as a robot) learns by interacting with its environment. During the training process, the robot's actions are defined as \"good\" or \"bad\" via a reward function. At each timestep of the reinforcement learning process, the robotic agent can see a (possibly partial) view of its environment called an observation. The agent can use this observation to determine which action to take. Depending on which action the agent takes (such as moving to the right), the agent will be rewarded accordingly. The overall goal in reinforcement learning is to maximize the cumulative reward. The reinforcement learning loop is referred to as a Markov Decision Process, as it follows the Markov Property: the robotic agent only needs its current state to determine which action to take (it doesn't need a history of its previous actions when considering its next action). \n",

    "The very condensed summary of Reinforcement Learning provided above describes a basic view of what Reinforcement Learning is, although there are many more details to be understood. For a better understanding (and to be able to complete the assignment for Part 2), please read Unit 1 and Unit 2 of the HuggingFace Deep RL Course: https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/en/unit0/introduction. This course will be your guide whilst completing the assignment for this section. It will cover the basics of Q-Learning, which you need to implement your own Reinforcement Learning algorithm. \n",

The following is a description of this environment, such as the action space, observation space, and starting state: https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/. Essentially, the overall goal is to keep the CartPole upright by moving it left (0) or right (1). You should use a Q-table to store the state-action values. \n",
